## Welcome to my GitHub Space!

I recently graduated from McGill University in Data Analytics and Iâ€™m interested in how data can be used to solve real problems.  
Here I share projects where I explore prediction, clustering, visualization, and optimization - mostly with Python, sometimes with R.  

## ðŸ”Ž Current Focus  
- Building end-to-end data pipelines  
- Testing machine learning models on real-world datasets  
- Learning how to make insights both accurate and useful

Feel free to browse through my repositories and donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you're interested in collaborating on a project or just want to chat about data analytics!

Best,  
Julien
